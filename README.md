Fregata: Machine Learning
==================================

[![GitHub license](./img/apache2.svg)](./LICENSE)

- [Fregata](http://talkingdata.com) is a light weight, super fast, large scale machine learning library on Spark.
 
- More accurate: For varied problems, Fregata can achieve more accurate results compared to MLLib.
 
- High speed: For General Linear Model, Fregata often converges in one data epcho. For a 1 billion X 1 billion data set, Fregata can train a General Linear Model in 1 minute or 10 minutes with or without memory caching respectively. Usually, Fregata is 10-100 times faster than MLLib.
 
- Parameter Free: Fregata has optimized SGD solver, which dosen't need to tune lerarning rate, because we found out a way to calculate appropriate learning rate in the training process. When confronted with super large-scale-dimension problem, Fregata calculates remaining memory dynamically to determine the sparseness of the output, balancing accuracy and efficiency automatically. Both features enable Fregata to be treated as a standard module in data processing for different problems.
 
- Light weight: Fregata just use Spark's standard API,  which allows it to be integrated into most businessâ€™ data processing flow on Spark quickly and seamlessly.

#### We will release soon
